## :warning: Security Warning

**Do not run executables from untrusted sources.**

The executable file in this directory was created directly from the source code in this project. You should only run this executable if you trust the source from which you obtained it.

Running executable files from the internet can be dangerous. Malicious code can be bundled into executables, potentially harming your computer, stealing data, or installing malware. Always verify the source of an application before running it.

Or just run the Python file directly - this has been created for convenience.
